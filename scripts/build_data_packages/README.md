This script can be used to create data packages for ATAK (Android)/WinTak/TAK Tracker/iTAK Tracker (since they use the same package structure) and iTAK (it requires different data package structure).

Folders you're expected to have:
./builder_data_packages.py
./package_raw 

Outputs
./output_ios - zips for iTAK
./output - zips for everything else

Remember to update the colors dictionary with all the users you plan to create packages for.
